                    Hi! My name is Syahmi. I am an active student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, currently enrolled 
                    in InfoComm Technology School, studying Information 
                    Technology course in Year 1. I love to do Mathematics & play 
                    sports such as basketball, football & tchoukball with my 
                    friends during my free time. Despite all the challenges 
                    I've had, I made it this far thanks to the friends & 
                    teachers I've had for the past few years. I joined 
                    Information Technology because I was intrigued at how 
                    technology will be used more often in the future. Jobs in this 
                    area are getting higher in demand & offers high-paying jobs which is 
                    why i am more interested in this pathway.

                        During my Semester Year 1 poly break, I wasn't actually planning to work because
                        I decided to rest after the semester. My friend introduced me to a flexible job that required 
                        F&B services to important guests such as Prime Ministers. For instance, picking up and serving 
                        food & beverages to them. I worked at a fixed location, which was the hotel called
                        Ritz Carlton. Through this working experience, I developed good teamwork and social skills as 
                        I had to communicate with other staffs to help carry out the wedding/events and also attend to 
                        the guests and communicate with them.

                        WALKING PARCEL DELIVERY
                    </header>
                    <p class="worktext">
                        I worked this job after I stopped working as a warehouse assistant at Nippon Express. I had
                        few more months before my post-secondary education starts so I decided to look for another job
                        as I did not want to waste any time sitting at home doing nothing. This job required me to work 
                        with my friend & go door to door to deliver parcel at specific locations. To illustrate this,
                        we had to load the van with parcels nicely, fit ourselves in the van full of parcels &
                        travel to the chosen neighbourhood. Through this working experience, I learn how to build my social
                        skills into talking to strangers & making sure I deliver correctly on time. I have to manage
                        my time properly so that the delivery process does not take too long.

                        WAREHOUSE ASSISTANT
                    </header>
                    <p class="worktext">
                        This job was my first proper part-time job where I had to wake up at 8am every morning. This was 
                        right after I finished my O-Levels major exam, I was invited by four of my friends to work together.
                        This job lasted me one month as we did not want to continue working. Being a warehouse assitant for UNIQLO
                        required me to carry heavy boxes & pick specific clothing properly. I had to work overtime everyday except
                        Sunday which was very tiring. Overall experience was fun & tough but I definitely learnt to be more 
                        disciplined in waking up & persevering through to earn money.
