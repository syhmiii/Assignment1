                    Hi! My name is Syahmi. I am an active student in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, currently enrolled 
                    in InfoComm Technology School, studying Information 
                    Technology course in Year 1. I love to do Mathematics & play 
                    sports such as basketball, football & tchoukball with my 
                    friends during my free time. Despite all the challenges 
                    I've had, I made it this far thanks to the friends & 
                    teachers I've had for the past few years. I joined 
                    Information Technology because I was intrigued at how 
                    technology will be used more often in the future. Jobs in this 
                    area are getting higher in demand & offers high-paying jobs which is 
                    why i am more interested in this pathway.

                        During my Semester Year 1 poly break, I wasn't actually planning to work because
                        I decided to rest after the semester. My friend introduced me to a flexible job that required 
                        F&B services to important guests such as Prime Ministers. For instance, picking up and serving 
                        food & beverages to them. I worked at a fixed location, which was the hotel called
                        Ritz Carlton. Through this working experience, I developed good teamwork and social skills as 
                        I had to communicate with other staffs to help carry out the wedding/events and also attend to 
                        the guests and communicate with them.

                    <p class="worktext">
                        I worked this job after I stopped working as a warehouse assistant at Nippon Express. I had
                        few more months before my post-secondary education starts so I decided to look for another job
                        as I did not want to waste any time sitting at home doing nothing. This job required me to work 
                        with my friend & go door to door to deliver parcel at specific locations. To illustrate this,
                        we had to load the van with parcels nicely, fit ourselves in the van full of parcels &
                        travel to the chosen neighbourhood. Through this working experience, I learn how to build my social
                        skills into talking to strangers & making sure I deliver correctly on time. I have to manage
                        my time properly so that the delivery process does not take too long.

                        This job was my first proper part-time job where I had to wake up at 8am every morning. This was 
                        right after I finished my O-Levels major exam, I was invited by four of my friends to work together.
                        This job lasted me one month as we did not want to continue working. Being a warehouse assitant for UNIQLO
                        required me to carry heavy boxes & pick specific clothing properly. I had to work overtime everyday except
                        Sunday which was very tiring. Overall experience was fun & tough but I definitely learnt to be more 
                        disciplined in waking up & persevering through to earn money.

                    I joined the National Tchoukball trials in 2019 and was selected to be part of the training team. 
                    I met many people from different backgrounds and made friends with them. Even though the trainings
                     was super tough, I had the motivation of my friends to keep going on. Currently, I am not inside 
                     anymore as I wanted to focus more on my studies. The experience there taught me perseverance and 
                     teamwork in life and adapt to more difficult situations in the future. There will always be a 
                     solution to the problem if I try to find it. Fall down eight times, stand up nine times. That's 
                     what I have learnt after suffering many tough journeys throughout my nationals trainings.

                        When I was in secondary 3, I was selected to go on an overseas trip with my fellow CCA mates. The 
                    destination was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I spent 3 days 2 nights with my CCA mates & also students 
                    from other CCA. We mostly trained together at different courts & competed with other teams that were 
                    much older & stronger than us. It was a definitely tough playing against them but getting experiences 
                    were what that was important. Other than that, I spent time with all my CCA mates and gotten closer in 
                    no time. We had so many activities such as icebreaker games & Laser Tag. It was so enjoyable & memorable 
                    use there was so much freedom I had during that 3 days as the Teachers In Charge did not care much.

                        were average as I was not prioritising my studies & just having fun. Throughout this journey, I 
                        learnt the importance of choosing the right friends & appreciating what life has for me. I achieved
                        good PSLE results that allowed me to enter EXPRESS in many different schools.

                        I am currently in Ngee Ann Poly, studying Information Technology in Year 1. In the beginning,
                        I had no interests in any course so I thought about the future, whether I wanted to enter 
                        university. I realised technolgy will be more used in the future so it was a great opportunity
                        for me to take the course while I had no interests. For now, I am barely coping with pile of work
                        & assignments so I have to manage my time more.

                        In 2017, I chose Jurongville as my first choice & studied there for 4 years because most of
                        my close friends were going there. I just wanted to keep my friendship and did not care about 
                        where I was going to study, as long as the school is near my house. At first, I chose Hua Yi 
                        but I realised I have to try to make friends again. Overall, it was better than i thought it will 
                        be, even though I distant from my old friends but made more incredible close friends. Throughout the
                        years, my grades kept improving as I was able to easily understand the contents and got a raw
                        aggregate of 13 for my O-Levels. I was then able to enter my dream polytechnic school, Ngee Ann Poly.

                        in the Crimson about Facemash (Facebook). I intended to create a website that could connect 
                        people around the university. As of February 2011, Facebook had become the largest online photo 
                        host, being cited by Facebook application and online photo aggregator Pixable as expecting to 
                        have 100 billion photos by summer 2011.

                        In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular 
                        networks, which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned 
                        successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones. 5G networks 
                        are predicted to have more than 1.7 billion subscribers worldwide by 2025, according to the GSM 
                        Association. All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the Internet and telephone network 
                        by radio waves through a local antenna in the cell. The main advantage of the new networks is that 
                        they will have greater bandwidth.
