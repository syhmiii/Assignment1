# My Portfolio
This project will consist of a portfolio of myself, showcasing my projects I have done throughout my education years & information about myself personally. Users can also contact me in the CONTACT ME section.

## Design Process
This website is for employers who are looking to hire me & working in the technology industry. It also follows a powerpoints slides presentation by clicking buttons to proceed to the next sections. I find this interactive as readers would not be feeling bored just reading my website. The last section has all my details to contact me if the employers are interested to hire. 

## Features
**Every section will have a different background and the theme is black.**

#### **Home**
Just to get the readers started with a simple sentence in the middle.

#### About Me
Introducing myself, how I look like, where I am studying at, what I am studying and more about myself such as my hobbies & interests.

#### **Work**
To show my work experience to my employers so that they get more interested since I experienced working different kinds of part-time jobs that expose me to different atmosphere & working colleagues. Users have to interact & click images to show the texts that will explain each one of my work experience.

#### **Co-Curricular**
To show what I have done for my CCA during Secondary School in terms of outside school & overseas trips.

#### **Education**
Similar to how my work experience was made, images of school logos to explain what school I chose to be in & what benefits me during those journey.

#### **Projects**
Hover below the projects images to know more about the the projects I have done, & the awards I have achieve during my education journey.

#### **Contact Me**
Information such as Phone Number, Email Address, LinkedIn Account will be displayed here so that employers can contact me if they are interested. There also might be a feedback form.
